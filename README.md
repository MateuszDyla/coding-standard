# Overview

----
[BitBag](https://bitbag.io/) coding standard helps you produce solid and maintainable code.
At [BitBag Coding Bible](https://github.com/BitBagCommerce/BitBagBible) you can get familiar with standard we have 
implemented in our library. [ECS](https://github.com/symplify/easy-coding-standard)
and [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) are responsible for keeping your code in order.

## We are here to help
This **open-source library was developed to help the community**. If you have any additional questions, would like help with installing or configuring the plugin, or need any assistance with your project - let us know!

# Installation without packagist

----

We work on stable, supported and up-to-date versions of packages. We recommend you to do the same.


Add repository and require-dev to your `composer.json`

```json
"repositories": [
  {
    "type": "vcs",
    "url": "git@github.com:MateuszDyla/coding-standard.git"
  }
],
"require-dev": {
  "bitbag/coding-standards": "dev-main",
}

```

Install package with composer  

```json
composer update
```


Add import line to your `ecs.php` file in root directory
```php

$containerConfigurator->import('vendor/bitbag/coding-standard/ecs.php');
```


## Usage

Just like with standard ECS, for example to check /src dir:
```bash
vendor/bin/ecs check src
```
If ECS found any standard violations, you can fix it by:
```bash
vendor/bin/ecs check src --fix
```
## Customization

#### ECS
It's possible to extends `root/ecs.php` by your own fixers
```php
use Your\Place\For\Fixer\FooBarFixer;
...
return static function (ContainerConfigurator $containerConfigurator): void {
$services->set(FooBarFixer::class);
```

#### PHPStan
You can set PHPStan rule level with following commands
```bash
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyze --configuration=vendor/bitbag/coding-standard/phpstan.neon src --level=8
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyze --configuration=vendor/bitbag/coding-standard/phpstan.neon tests --level=5
```
